# 🐘 Yali GitHub  

Welcome to **yali-github** — my sandbox for learning GitHub and building a visible portfolio.  
This repo is a mix of notes, experiments, and small security-focused scripts.  

---

## 🔹 Why this repo?
I created this space to:  
- Practice using **Git & GitHub** (branches, commits, pull requests).  
- Collect small **scripts & utilities** I write while learning.  
- Keep track of **checklists / notes** from my VAPT & Red Teaming journey.  

---

## 📂 Contents (so far)
- `notes/` → markdown notes on tools & workflows  
- `scripts/` → small automation snippets (Python, Bash)  
- `checklists/` → security testing methodology references  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add a simple Python script (e.g. recon starter)  
- Document GitHub workflow (branch → commit → PR → merge)  
- Expand notes on **AWS security checks**

## ⚖️ Disclaimer
This repo is for **learning & practice** only.  
Security-related scripts are for **authorized environments** — do not misuse.
